HTML Tutorial
-------------
Html contains tags that display text data. Everytag has a closing tag. For ex, 
    
    <body>some text</body>.

Note: The tags together with data inside it is called markup element. 
Note: There are few tags you don't need an end tag. they are called empty tag. For ex, 
  
    <br> 
is a line break. It doesn't need end element.
