HTML Tutorial
-------------
Html contains tags that display text data. Everytag has a closing tag. For ex, 
    
    <body>some text</body>.

Note: The tags together with data inside it is called markup element. <br>
Note: There are few tags you don't need an end tag. they are called empty tag. For ex, 
  
    <br> 
is a line break. It doesn't need end element because we are not writing anything in between. one br tag gives one line spacing in the document. If you want one character spacing, use nbsp. i.e.

    &nbsp
